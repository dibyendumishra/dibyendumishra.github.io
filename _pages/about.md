I am a PhD Student in the Department of [Computing and Information Science](https://bowers.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. In my research, I broadly investigate the socio-political implications of civic technologies and figure out substantive ways to account for them. In my doctoral studies, I am investigating the mutual shaping of technology, work and organisations, especially in moments of crises. 

In the past, I used to work for a government agency in India building decision support systems and conducting risk and fairness analysis for rural infrastructures and livelihoods programs. Prior to that, I was researcher engrossed in the world of political social media, exploring disinformation campaigns and influencer networks. You can find more about these in the publications section and my CV!
